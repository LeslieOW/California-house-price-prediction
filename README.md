Building a linear regression model to predict house prices in California.

## A Regression Model to Predict House Prices using California Housing Dataset.

 My focus on this model is to build a robust Machine Learning model that predicts the housing prices in Califonia in US. The data was collected by US Census Bureau in 1990.

 This data has metrics such as the population, median income, median hous‚Äê
ing price, and so on for each block group in California. Block groups are the smallest 
geographical unit for which the US Census Bureau publishes sample data (a block
group typically has a population of 600 to 3,000 people).

Basically each instance(row) in the data contains data from a block group.

Each step taken to build the Machine Learning model is discussed below.
